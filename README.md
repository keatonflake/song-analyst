## Overview

In this dataset, we observe statistics about the top 100 songs as recorded on Spotify. For more details, please refer to the original dataset on Kaggle: [Top 100 Songs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thebumpkin/600-billboard-hot-100-tracks-with-spotify-data).

### Question 1: Least to Most Popular Artist

Based on this dataset what is the ranked list of artists by popularity?

### Question 2: Energy vs. Popularity

If a song has high energy, does it have a higher probability of being more popular?

To explore this question, a scatter plot of energy vs. popularity was created to illustrate the relationship between these two variables.

### Question 3: Duration vs. Popularity

If a song has a shorter duration, does it have a higher probability of being more popular?

Similarly, a scatter plot of duration vs. popularity was created to visualize this relationship.
