        <h1>Project Summary</h1>
        <p>This project explores the relationship between popularity and duration of songs recorded on Spotify. The
            dataset includes various songs by multiple artists, along with metrics such as duration, energy,
            danceability, loudness, and average popularity scores. Using Python Pandas and Plotly, and javascript.
            I attempted to answer 3 questions:</p>
        <div class="list">
            <p>1. Based on this dataset what is the ranked list of artists by popularity?</p>
            <p>2. What is the relationship between popularity and energy?</p>
            <p>3. What is the relationship between popularity and duration?</p>

        <h1>Artist Summary</h1>
        <p>The dataset includes various songs by multiple artists, along with metrics such as
            duration, energy, danceability, loudness, and average popularity scores. The popularity scores range from 0
            to 100, indicating the average popularity of each artist based on their recorded songs.</p>

        <p>Conclusion: At the time of this dataset "The Weeknd" was the #1 most popular artist</p>
    </div>

    <div class="summary" id="popularity_vs_energy">
        <h1>Popularity vs. Energy</h1>
        <p>The relationship between popularity and energy is explored by plotting the average
            popularity scores against the energy levels of the artistsâ€™ songs. Energy levels range from 0 to 1, where
            lower values indicate a more relaxed feel and higher values indicate a more intense and energetic feel.</p>

        <p>Conclusion: Suprisingly, based on this dataset, there is a slight correlation between lower energy and more
            popularity. Though it is in the margin of error, it is still noticable.</p>

    <div class="summary" id="popularity_vs_duration">
        <h1>Popularity vs. Duration</h1>
        <p>The analysis of popularity against song duration examines how the length of songs
            (measured in milliseconds) impacts their average popularity scores.
            This relationship can reveal whether shorter or longer songs tend to be more
            popular. For instance, if shorter songs show higher popularity, it might suggest that audiences prefer
            quick, catchy tunes. Alternatively, longer songs may indicate deeper engagement when they resonate well with
            listeners.</p>
